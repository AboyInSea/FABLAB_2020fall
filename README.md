# FABLAB COURSE
Helloï¼ŒI'm **ZHANG Wei**, a junior undergraduate student from [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), who is majoring in Computer Science. And I attend FAB Academy X China course in ShanghaiTech,spring 2020. The followings are my assignments and my final project.

### WEEK 1: Laser Cut

1. Use  fusion 360 to design a simple module.
2. Cut a sample  by laser cutter to calculate the kerf.
   1. turn on the laser cutter, the airflow and the exhaust filter.
   2. Insert a sheet of material.
   3. Focus the laser head automatically.
   4. Set the properies of laser cutter in PC and send the file to laser cutter. In my experience, I set the power, speed, PPI be 70%, 3%, 1000, respectively.
I cut a 5 mm by 5 mm square, and then I get a about 4.7 mm by 4.7 mm suare. Therefore, \(kerf = (5 mm - 4.7 mm)/2 = 0.15 mm \)
3. Modify my module and cut them.
4. Assemble them together.
