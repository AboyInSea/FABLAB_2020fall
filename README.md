# FABLAB COURSE
Hello，I'm **ZHANG Wei**, a junior undergraduate student from [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), who is majoring in Computer Science. And I attend FAB Academy X China course in ShanghaiTech,spring 2020. The followings are my assignments and my final project.

## WEEK 1: Laser Cut， A Storage Box

1. Use fusion 360 to design a simple module.

2. Cut a sample  by laser cutter to calculate the kerf.
   1. turn on the laser cutter, the airflow and the exhaust filter.
   2. Insert a sheet of material.
   3. Focus the laser head automatically.
   4. Set the properies of laser cutter in PC and send the file to laser cutter. In my experience, I set the power, speed, PPI be 70%, 3%, 1000, respectively.
I cut a 5 mm by 5 mm square, and then I get a about 4.7 mm by 4.7 mm suare. Therefore, kerf = (5 mm - 4.7 mm)/2 = 0.15 mm
3. Modify my module and cut them.

4. Assemble them together.

## WEEK 2: 3D Print: Finger Tiger
1. Use fusion 360 to design a module.
   1. download a finger tiger picture.

   2. sketch the shape and polish it by fusion 360.
    
2. Slicing.
   Adjust the size and location of the module.Set layer height, speed be 0.15 mm, 40 mm, respectively.
